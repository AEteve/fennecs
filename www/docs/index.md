# Welcome to the last ECS of your life!
Outfox Game Dev Complexity with **fenn**ecs, a clever, quick, tiny Entity Component System!

::: info :neofox_knives: THE COOKBOOK - Tutorials and Tricks
Feeling snackish? Try **fenn**ecs for yourself as you flip through the courses of our **[Cookbook](/cookbook/index)**. Snack on easily digestible code samples, and come back whenever you need to to jog your memory.

üç¥üëáüëá *Here! Grab a fork and have an am√ºse-gueueu... horse-≈ìuf... treat!*

::: code-group
```cs [ü¶ä 1, 2, 3 - gravity!]
var world = new fennecs.World();
var entity = world.Spawn().Add<Vector3>();
var query = world.Query<Vector3>().Compile();

Stream.For(static (ref Vector3 velocity, float dt) => {
    velocity.Y -= 9.81f * dt;
}, uniform: Time.Delta);
```

::: tip :neofox_book: THE DOCS - all the Deets and Don'ts
The **Documentation** section (you're in it now!) describes the core principles of **fenn**ecs C# API. The nuget package also has extensive XMLdoc coverage to keep you informed while you code and explore in your IDE of choice. (neovim obviously, but also Rider or VSCode, any IDE, really)

#### Great first pick?

::: info :neofox_vr: THE EXAMPLES - Smol, Shiny Demos
The **[Demos](/examples/index)** category has concrete examples for a growing list of renderers and game engines! Something useful and something pretty to look at at the same time? It cannot be possible, *and yet!*

::: info :neofox_pat_floof: THE REST
The **Misc** section contains our [Glossary](/misc/Glossary.md) of terms and a few [heartfelt words of thanks.](/misc/Acknowledgements.md), and anything else that didn't fit elsewhere.
