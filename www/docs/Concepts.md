# ~~Entities~~ Foxes for the Win!
The Entity Component System (ECS) is an architectural pattern used in game development and software design. It focuses on the composition of entities using components, rather than inheritance. Entities are unique identifiers, components are pure data structures, and systems are the logic that operates on entities and their components. ECS promotes flexibility, performance, and maintainability by separating data from behavior and enabling the creation of complex game objects through the composition of simpler components.

# Typical ECS Concepts 

::: tip <sub>*(these are what makes most ECS architectures tick)*</sub>
### [Entities](Entities/) are spawned in a [World](World.md). 
Entities can be spawned solo, or in bulk with pre-configured components.

### [Components](Components/) can be added to / removed from Entities.
Components can be backed by any type; Value or Reference, even empty `structs`.

### [Queries](Queries/) filter Entities using [Match Expressions](Queries/Matching.md).
This matching is done by Component types and targets (presence or absence).

### Code [Acts](Streams/Stream.For.md) on Component data in tight, optimized loops.
You provide logic in [Runner Delegates](Streams/Delegates.md) which are executed on a [single](Streams/Stream.For.md) or [multiple](Streams/Stream.Job.md) threads.

### Component data is always kept contiguous* in Memory.
Structurally similar Entities are packed into [Archetypes](/docs/Components/index.md#archetype) for improved [cache locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference).

# Unique fennecs Concepts 

::: warning <sub>*(~~weird~~ cool stuff made us you all wide-eyed and bushy tailed again)*</sub>
### [Relations](/docs/Components/Relation.md) are Components with an [Entity Target](Queries/Matching.md#match-targets).
These add expressive, powerful grouping semantics. Relations can be backed by any type.

### [Links](/docs/Components/Link.md) are Components backed by an [Object Target](Queries/Matching.md#match-targets).
Group Entities logically and in memory by linking them to shared data, like a physics world.

### [Streams](Streams/) expose *fast* Iteration and SIMD Ops 
Efficiently and safely [iterate entities](Streams/Stream.For.md), or [blit](Streams/SIMD.md) Components in bulk - read/write entire [memory blocks](Streams/Stream.Raw.md).

### Queries expose Structural Changes (just as Entities do)
Efficiently and safely [add](Queries/CRUD.md), [remove](Queries/CRUD.md) from individual Entities or entire matched Queries.

### Runners let you pass [uniform](Streams/Stream.For.md#uniforms-shmuniforms) data to those Workloads.
A tiny tidbit that streamlines the process of passing data into a job or run.

### Worlds and Queries are `IEnumerable<Entity>`.
It's amazing to be able to every now and then just LINQ it up and <u>*be done*</u> somewhere.

### There are no formalized Systems.
You have a higher degree of freedom when and how to interact with Queries and Stream Views.

### There is no formalized Scheduler.
Parallel Jobs execute synchronously, as fast as possible. Runners are invokable anytime, anywhere.  

### Structural Changes may be submitted\* *at any time.*
Worlds process them at the end of a Query Runner's scope, otherwise immediately.
