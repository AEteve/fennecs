### Ok, what the fox? *Another ECS?!*
# :neofox_facepalm: We know... oh, _we know._    

In a tiny nutshell, **fenn**ecs is an archetype-based [ðŸ”—Entity-Component System (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). ECS is an architecture and Design Pattern most commonly used in **Game Development** and **Simulation Software**. It facilitates rapid creation, copying, changing, and querying of data and relationships at microsecond scale. This makes it play exceptionally well with game engines and real-time applications like interactive simulations. 

Our cheeky little library lives up to its name by all at once being **small, clever, quick,** *and <u>full of</u>* **trash-tier puns!**
