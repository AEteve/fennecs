features:
  - title: Intuitively Relational.
    details: A unique relation system <u>keeps you in charge</u> of how your Entities and Objects relate each other. Queries feed data straight to your code, filtered, and parallel across CPU cores.
  - title: Minimal Boilerplate.
    details: Works right out of the box. Plays nice with many game engines. <u>Make choices, not compromises!</u> Light enough to add as final touch, strong enough to build upon from the start.
  - title: Zero Dependencies. Zero Codegen.

**But it had to be done.** In a tiny nutshell, **fenn**ecs is an archetype-based ECS that proves: "small", "clever", and "fast" don't have to be mutually exclusive attributes to look for in a game or simulation development library. And, by the way, did we mention it's free & libre open source software (MIT license)?

### Let's dare to be all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again!
