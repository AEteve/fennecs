# Ok, what the fox? *Another ECS?!*
### :neofox_facepalm: We know... oh, _we know._    

In a tiny nutshell, **fenn**ecs is an archetype-based [ðŸ”—Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (Wikipedia) and embodies "small", "clever", and "fast". We see its primary use is in game and simulation development! And, by the way, did we mention it's free & libre open source software (MIT license)?

### Time to get all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again!
