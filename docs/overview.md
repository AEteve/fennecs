# What the fox, another ECS?!

We know... oh, *we know.* üò©Ô∏è

### But in a nutshell, **[fennecs](https://fennecs.tech)** is...

 üêæ zero codegen  
 üêæ minimal boilerplate  
 üêæ archetype-based  
 üêæ intuitively relational  
 üêæ lithe and fast  

 
**fennecs** is a re-imagining of [RelEcs/HypEcs](https://github.com/Byteron/HypEcs), extended and compacted until it *feels just right* for high performance game development in any modern C# engine.

## Quickstart: Let's go!
üì¶`>` `dotnet add package fennecs`

At the basic level, all you need is a üß©**component type**, a number of ~~small foxes~~ ü¶ä**entities**, and a query to ‚öôÔ∏è**iterate and modify** components, occasionally passing in some uniform üíæ**data**.

```csharp
// Declare your own component types. (you can also use most existing value or reference types)
using Position = System.Numerics.Vector3;

// Create a world. (fyi, World implements IDisposable)
var world = new fennecs.World();

// Spawn an entity into the world with a choice of components. (or add/remove them later)
var entity = world.Spawn().Add<Position>().Id();

// Queries are cached, just build them right where you want to use them.
var query = world.Query<Position>().Build();

// Run code on all entities in the query. (omit chunksize to parallelize only by archetype)
query.Job(static (ref Position position, float dt) => {
    position.Y -= 9.81f * dt;
}, uniform: Time.Delta, chunkSize: 2048);
```

### üí¢... when we said minimal boilerplate, *we foxing meant it.*

Even using the strictest judgment, that's no more than 2 lines of boilerplate! Merely instantiating the world and building the query aren't directly moving parts of the actor/gravity feature we just built, and should be seen as "enablers" or "infrastructure".

The üí´*real magic*üí´ is that none of this brevity compromises on performance.

## Features: What's in the box?

**fennECS** is a tiny, tiny ECS with a focus on performance and simplicity. And it cares enough to provide a few things you might not expect. Our competition sure didn't.

------------------------

## üí°Highlights / Design Goals

- [x] Modern C# 12 codebase, targeting .NET 8.
- [x] Full Unit Test coverage.
- [ ] Benchmarking suite. (Work in Progress)

- [x] Workloads can be easily parallelized across *and within* Archetypes

- [x] Expressive, queryable relations between Entities and Objects
- [x] Entity Structural Changes with O(1) time complexity (per individual change).
- [x] Entity-Component Queries with O(1) runtime lookup time complexity.

- [x] No code generation and no reflection required.

## ‚è© Nimble: _**fenn**ecs_ benchmarks

Preliminary (WIP) benchmarks suggest you can expect to process over 2 million components per millisecond on a 2020 CPU.
We worked hard to minimize allocations, though convenience, especially parallelization, has a tiny GC cost.

_**fenn**ecs_ provides a variety of ways to iterate over and modify components, to offer a good balance of control and elegance without compromising too much.

Here are some raw results from our benchmark suite, from the Vector3 operations parts, better ones soon.
(don't @ us)

## üìÖ Future Roadmap

- üü¶ Unity Support: Planned for when Unity is on .NET 8 or later, and C# 12 or later. Or when we can't wait any longer.
- ‚úÖ ~~_**fenn**ecs_ as a NuGet package~~ (done!)
- üü¶ _**fenn**ecs_ as a Godot addon
