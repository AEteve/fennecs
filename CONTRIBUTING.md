## Current Project Status

**fenn**ecs is in its early stages, which means it's highly flexible and open to evolution. While this is exciting, it also means we need to be mindful of its direction.

⚠️ **Important Note**: We're currently focused on realizing the core vision of **fenn**ecs. As such, unsolicited feature additions might not be accepted. To avoid disappointment, please discuss substantial changes with us before investing your valuable time.

However, we absolutely encourage you to experiment and build anything you like in your own forks of **fenn**ecs. We'd love to hear about your creations!

## Need Help?

For support questions, please join our vibrant community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Bfx74WcVXW). The issue tracker is reserved for bug reports and feature discussions.

## Ground Rules

1. New contributors should submit their work as Pull Requests via GitHub.
2. All contributions must be compatible with the MIT license. If you're including MIT-licensed work from others, please let us know so we can properly attribute them.
3. As **fenn**ecs is distributed as a .NET package on NuGet (and potentially other registries), contributions should not introduce dependencies to other packages or include game-engine-specific code paths.
4. Engine-specific code and bindings are welcome, but in supplementary packages (e.g., the `fennecs-godot` addon).

## Attribution

We value your contributions! Contributors will be listed in the project's MIT [LICENSE](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs/blob/main/LICENSE) file. We'll use your real name if provided, or your GitHub username otherwise. The order is based on commit counts as shown in the [Contributors](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs/graphs/contributors) section on GitHub.

## Thank You!

**fenn**ecs is crafted with 💘 love & foxes 🦊, but it's *made by amazing people **like you!***
