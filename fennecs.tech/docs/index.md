# Welcome to the last ECS of your life!

::: tip :neofox_book: DOCUMENTATION
The **Documentation** section (you're in it now!) describes the core principles of **fenn**ecs C# API. The nuget package also has extensive XMLdoc coverage to keep you informed while you code and explore in your IDE of choice. (neovim obviously, but also Rider or VSCode, any IDE, really)

Suggested first picks:
- [Entity](Entity)
- [Queries](Queries/index)

::: info :neofox_knives: THE COOKBOOK
Ready to try **fenn**ecs for yourself? Flip through the [Cookbook](/cookbook/index) for some quick and easily digestible code samples that get you started in no time! Come back whenever you need to to jog your memory.
:::

::: info :neofox_vr: THE DEMOS
The [Demos](/demos/index) category has some concrete examples for a growing list of renderers and game engines! Something useful and something pretty to look at at the same time? Oh my!
:::

::: info :neofox_pat_floof: MISCELLANY
The last section contains our [Glossary](/misc/Glossary.md) of terms and a few [heartfelt words of thanks.](/misc/Acknowledgements.md), and anything else that didn't fit elsewhere.
