# Ok, what the fox? Another ECS?! 
### :neofox_pensive: We know... oh, _we know._    
 But in a nutshell, **fenn**ecs is...

🐾 zero codegen
🐾 minimal boilerplate
🐾 archetype-based
🐾 intuitively relational
🐾 lithe and fast 🐾

And that's all there is to say before you go and see for yourself.

### All wide-eyed and bushy-tailed!
