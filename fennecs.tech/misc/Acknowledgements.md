# Acknowledgements

## Byteron
Many thanks to [Byteron (Aaron Winter)](https://github.com/Byteron) for creating [HypEcs](https://github.com/Byteron/HypEcs) and [RelEcs](https://github.com/Byteron/RelEcs), the inspiring libraries that **fenn**ecs evolved from. (refined with a dash of [LitEcs](https://github.com/Byteron/LitEcs) after his own suggestion)

**fenn**ecs started as a friendly fork, and gradually devolved into a respectful rewrite. It proudly inherits the original project's MIT license, hoping to spawn more forks and friendships.


## n00t
Thanks to n00t on the [Godot Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4JBkykG) for suggesting to make the cubes in the [DemoCubes](../examples/DemoCubes.md) example occasionally arrangeinto a sphere. That, and for the much, much less impactful deed of suggesting [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), the amazing SSG this site was made with.


## Volpeon
Their [Neofox emojis](https://volpeon.ink/emojis/) gleefully took over this site and fill the air with the pitter-patter of tiny paws, the sound of laughter, and delightful mischief.
