# Paying a visit to everyone who crossed you

::: info :neofox_floof_mug: MMMH, REAL CODE
Yes, it **RUNS**! *Playful premises aside*, this is a functioning showcase of **fenn**ecs features.

All `.csproj` and `.cs` files are [over there on Github!](https://github.com/thygrrr/fennecs/blob/main/examples/cookbook) 

 Get comfy, grab a cup of ~~Java~~ ~~CoffeeScript~~ ~~Visual J#~~ whatever, and check out the cookbook projects.

And then get your paws dirty playing around in the code yourself!
