# How to cook a fox.
:neofox_knife: Okay, listen up - don't! Or you'll get stabbed, easy as that.

### Examples! Piping hot! More coming fresh out of the oven by the hour!

::: tip WHAT THEY ARE
These examples are runnable code giving an overview over **fenn**ecs features and functionality.
They're a playground you can use to experiment with concepts and components and - 
learning by doing.

They also play with different ways of accessing data through **fenn**ecs to give you a taste of what's possible, and expand your palate and repertoire.
:::

::: warning WHAT THEY'RE NOT
These examples are not best practices, nor good practices. _**They're practice.**_


Use them as you gradually build an understanding and mental model of **fenn**ecs, and good habits will fall into place all on their own. Then, return to that overscoped game project of yours and get cooking!
