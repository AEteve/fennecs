# How to cook a fox.
:neofox_knife: Okay, listen up - don't! Or you'll get stabbed, easy as that.

### Examples! Piping hot! More coming fresh out of the oven by the hour!
We decided to provide concrete examples in a tasty, bite-size way that plays with semantics and pop culture, as well as showcasing a variety of different styles of interacting with **fenn**ecs.

::: tip :neofox_solder: WHAT THE RECIPES ARE
These examples are runnable code giving an overview over **fenn**ecs features and functionality.
They're a playground you can use to experiment with concepts and components and - 
learning by doing.

They also toy with different ways of accessing data through **fenn**ecs to give you a taste of what's possible, and expand your palate and repertoire.
:::

Got an idea? Contributions are welcome! They need to run, they need to provide line-by-line documentation, and if possible, they should fit into a single file.

::: warning :neofox_solder_googly: WHAT THEY'RE NOT
These examples are not best practices, nor good practices. _**They're practice.**_


Use them as you gradually build an understanding and mental model of **fenn**ecs, and good habits will fall into place all on their own.

Later, when you return to that overscoped game project of yours, you can get cooking *for real!*

### Now go, get'em, foxy!
